\section{System Architecture}

\albert{We realized that not a single ``operator'' should be responsible for all aspects of the system.}


\subsection{Goals}
\albert{...for breaking things into interoperable components. These are a subset of foggish goals (which might include performance isolation etc.)}


\subsection{Design Principles}
\albert{Roughly: 1, separate along trust boundaries. 2, make parts self-sustainable and useful by themselves. 3, stable inter-component interfaces. 4, flexible UIs.}


\subsection{Components}
\albert{These guys implement additional foggish goals.}
