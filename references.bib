In the context of “Industrial Internet”, where the operation of complex physical machinery is integrated with networked sensors and software applications, IoT is under- stood as a technological enabler of significant advances in the efficiency of industrial processes. In this paper, we elaborate on the main challenges brought on by the Industrial Internet and identify its key enabling technologies relevant to the Fog Computing paradigm. Further on, we propose the introduction of an Adaptive Operations Platform (AOP) to provide end-to- end manageability of the enabling Fog Computing infrastructure according to the operational requirements of industrial process. We present our prototype setup for AOP and elaborate on its performance evaluation in a typical industrial scenario.},

Due to the intrinsic nature of the IoT: heterogeneous devices/resources, a tightly coupled perception-action cycle and widely distributed devices and processing, application development in the Fog can be challenging. To address these challenges, we propose a Distributed Dataflow (DDF) programming model for the IoT that utilises computing infrastructures across the Fog and the Cloud. We evaluate our proposal by implementing a DDF framework based on Node-RED (Distributed Node-RED or D-NR), a visual programming tool that uses a flow-based model for building IoT applications. Via demonstrations, we show that our approach eases the development process and can be used to build a variety of IoT applications that work efficiently in the Fog.},

  abstract = {The recent advances in cloud services technology are fueling a plethora of information technology innovation, including networking, storage, and computing. Today, various flavors have evolved of IoT, cloud computing, and so-called fog computing, a concept referring to capabilities of edge devices and users' clients to compute, store, and exchange data among each other and with the cloud. Although the rapid pace of this evolution was not easily foreseeable, today each piece of it facilitates and enables the deployment of what we commonly refer to as a smart scenario, including smart cities, smart transportation, and smart homes. As most current cloud, fog, and network services run simultaneously in each scenario, we observe that we are at the dawn of what may be the next big step in the cloud computing and networking evolution, whereby services might be executed at the network edge, both in parallel and in a coordinated fashion, as well as supported by the unstoppable technology evolution. As edge devices become richer in functionality and smarter, embedding capacities such as storage or processing, as well as new functionalities, such as decision making, data collection, forwarding, and sharing, a real need is emerging for coordinated management of fog-to-cloud (F2C) computing systems. This article introduces a layered F2C architecture, its benefits and strengths, as well as the arising open and research challenges, making the case for the real need for their coordinated management. Our architecture, the illustrative use case presented, and a comparative performance analysis, albeit conceptual, all clearly show the way forward toward a new IoT scenario with a set of existing and unforeseen services provided on highly distributed and dynamic compute, storage, and networking resources, bringing together heterogeneous and commodity edge devices, emerging fogs, as well as conventional clouds.},

  abstract = {The recent rapid development of urbanization and Internet of things (IoT) encourages more and more research on Smart City in which computing devices are widely distributed and huge amount of dynamic real-time data are collected and processed. Although vast volume of dynamic data are available for extracting new living patterns and making urban plans, efficient data processing and instant decision making are still key issues, especially in emergency situations requesting quick response with low latency. Fog Computing, as the extension of Cloud Computing, enables the computing tasks accomplished directly at the edge of the network and is characterized as low latency and real time computing. However, it is non-trivial to coordinate highly heterogeneous Fog Computing nodes to function as a homogeneous platform. In this paper, taking urban traffic surveillance as a case study, a dynamic video stream processing scheme is proposed to meet the requirements of real-time information processing and decision making. Furthermore, we have explored the potential to enable multi-target tracking function using a simpler single target tracking algorithm. A prototype is built and the performance is evaluated. The experimental results show that our scheme is a promising solution for smart urban surveillance applications.},

Cloud computing technologies have the potential to improve road safety and traveling experience in ITSs by providing flexible solutions (i.e., alternative routes, synchronization of traffic lights, etc.) needed by various road safety actors such as police, and disaster and emergency services. In order to improve traffic safety and provide computational services to road users, a new cloud computing model called VANET-Cloud applied to vehicular ad hoc networks is proposed. Various transportation services provided by VANET-Cloud are reviewed, and some future research directions are highlighted, including security and privacy, data aggregation, energy efficiency, interoperability, and resource management.},

However, architecture and methodological approaches are still prevalent in the literature, while few research activities have specifically targeted so far the issues of practical feasibility, cost-effectiveness, and efficiency of fog solutions over easily-deployable environments. In this perspective, this paper originally presents i) our fog-oriented framework for Internet-of-Things applications based on innovative scalability extensions of the open-source Kura gateway and ii) its Docker-based containerization over challenging and resource-limited fog nodes, i.e., RaspberryPi devices. Our practical experience and experimental work show the feasibility of using even extremely constrained nodes as fog gateways; the reported results demonstrate that good scalability and limited overhead can be coupled, via proper configuration tuning and implementation optimizations, with the significant advantages of containerization in terms of flexibility and easy deployment, also when working on top of existing, off-the-shelf, and limited-cost gateway nodes.},

  abstract = {Conventional centralized cloud computing is a success for benefits such as on-demand, elasticity, and high colocation of data and computation. However, the paradigm shift towards “Internet of things” (IoT) will pose some unavoidable challenges: (1) massive data volume impossible for centralized datacenters to handle; (2) high latency between edge “things” and centralized datacenters; (3) monopoly, inhibition of innovations, and non-portable applications due to the proprietary application delivery in centralized cloud. The emergence of edge cloud gives hope to address these challenges. In this paper, we propose a new framework called “HomeCloud” focusing on an open and efficient new application delivery in edge cloud integrating two complementary technologies: Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software-Defined Networking (SDN). We also present a preliminary proof-of-concept testbed demonstrating the whole process of delivering a simple multi-party chatting application in the edge cloud. In the future, the HomeCloud framework can be further extended to support other use cases that demand portability, cost-efficiency, scalability, flexibility, and manageability. To the best of our knowledge, this framework is the first effort aiming at facilitating new application delivery in such a new edge cloud context.},

Rockwell Science Center has assembled a wearable testbed for AR applications, comprised only of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware components. The system is designed to be worn like a jacket, with all the hardware attached and affixed to a vest frame (Xybernaut) with concealed routing of cables under Velcro channels. Two possible configurations allow the system to be used either in a stand-alone mode (the Intelligent Tetherless Wearable Augmented Reality Navigation System, or “itWARNS”) or to be linked to a larger-scale multi-modal user interface testbed (the Wearable Immersive Multi-Media Information System, or “WIMMIS”). Completely tetherless operation is made possible by wireless digital connections as well as analog video and 3D audio connections over radio frequencies (RF). This paper describes these two testbed configurations, as well as some of the AR applications developed on this testbed},

  abstract = {High latency, network congestion and network bottleneck are some of problems in cloud computing. Moving from centralized to decentralized paradigm, Edge computing could offload the processing to the edge which indirectly reduces application response time and improves overall user experience. This paper evaluate Docker, a container based technology as a platform for Edge Computing. 4 fundamental criteria were evaluated 1) deployment and termination, 2) resource \& service management, 3) fault tolerance and 4) caching. Based on our evaluation and experiment Docker provides fast deployment, small footprint and good performance which make it potentially a viable Edge Computing platform.},

  abstract = {Cloud computing and Internet of Things (IoT) are two very different technologies that are both already part of our life. Their adoption and use are expected to be more and more pervasive, making them important components of the Future Internet. A novel paradigm where Cloud and IoT are merged together is foreseen as disruptive and as an enabler of a large number of application scenarios.
In this paper, we focus our attention on the integration of Cloud and IoT, which is what we call the CloudIoT paradigm. Many works in literature have surveyed Cloud and IoT separately and, more precisely, their main properties, features, underlying technologies, and open issues. However, to the best of our knowledge, these works lack a detailed analysis of the new CloudIoT paradigm, which involves completely new applications, challenges, and research issues. To bridge this gap, in this paper we provide a literature survey on the integration of Cloud and IoT. Starting by analyzing the basics of both IoT and Cloud Computing, we discuss their complementarity, detailing what is currently driving to their integration. Thanks to the adoption of the CloudIoT paradigm a number of applications are gaining momentum: we provide an up-to-date picture of CloudIoT applications in literature, with a focus on their specific research challenges. These challenges are then analyzed in details to show where the main body of research is currently heading. We also discuss what is already available in terms of platforms–both proprietary and open source–and projects implementing the CloudIoT paradigm. Finally, we identify open issues and future directions in this field, which we expect to play a leading role in the landscape of the Future Internet.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices/sensors has increased to a great extent. To support the computational demand of real-time latency-sensitive applications of largely geo-distributed IoT devices/sensors, a new computing paradigm named "Fog computing" has been introduced. Generally, Fog computing resides closer to the IoT devices/sensors and extends the Cloud-based computing, storage and networking facilities. In this chapter, we comprehensively analyse the challenges in Fogs acting as an intermediate layer between IoT devices/ sensors and Cloud datacentres and review the current developments in this field. We present a taxonomy of Fog computing according to the identified challenges and its key features.We also map the existing works to the taxonomy in order to identify current research gaps in the area of Fog computing. Moreover, based on the observations, we propose future directions for research.},

  abstract = {The Internet of Everything (IoE) solutions gradually bring every object online, and processing data in centralized cloud does not scale to requirements of such environment. This is because, there are applications such as health monitoring and emergency response that require low latency and delay caused by transferring data to the cloud and then back to the application can seriously impact the performance. To this end, Fog computing has emerged, where cloud computing is extended to the edge of the network to decrease the latency and network congestion. Fog computing is a paradigm for managing a highly distributed and possibly virtualized environment that provides compute and network services between sensors and cloud data centers. This chapter provides background and motivations on emergence of Fog computing and defines its key characteristics. In addition, a reference architecture for Fog computing is presented and recent related development and applications are discussed.},

In this paper, we have discussed current definitions of fog computing and similar concepts, and proposed a more comprehensive definition. We also analyzed the goals and challenges in fog computing platform, and presented platform design with several exemplar applications.

  abstract = {Vehicular Adhoc Networks (VANETs) have been attracted a lot of research recent years. Although VANETs are deployed in reality offering several services, the current architecture has been facing many difficulties in deployment and management because of poor connectivity, less scalability, less flexibility and less intelligence. We propose a new VANET architecture called FSDN which combines two emergent computing and network paradigm Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Fog Computing as a prospective solution. SDN-based architecture provides flexibility, scalability, programmability and global knowledge while Fog Computing offers delay-sensitive and location-awareness services which could be satisfy the demands of future VANETs scenarios. We figure out all the SDN-based VANET components as well as their functionality in the system. We also consider the system basic operations in which Fog Computing are leveraged to support surveillance services by taking into account resource manager and Fog orchestration models. The proposed architecture could resolve the main challenges in VANETs by augmenting Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I), Vehicle-to-Base Station communications and SDN centralized control while optimizing resources utility and reducing latency by integrating Fog Computing. Two use-cases for non-safety service (data streaming) and safety service (Lane-change assistance) are also presented to illustrate the benefits of our proposed architecture.},

In addition, with the introduction and rising use of mobile devices, the Internet of Things (IoT) has recently received considerable attention since the IoT has brought physical devices and connected them to the Internet, enabling each device to share data with surrounding devices and virtualized technologies in real-time. Consequently, the exploding data usage requires a new, innovative computing platform that can provide robust real-time data analytics and resource provisioning to clients. As a result, fog computing has recently been introduced to provide computation, storage and networking services between the end-users and traditional cloud computing data centers.
