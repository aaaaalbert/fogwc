\section{Introduction And Related Work}
In recent years the term ``fog computing'' has been established to describe
cloud computing at the edge of the network. Fog networks are typically
characterized by the large number of geographically distributed nodes, ranging
from embedded systems, e.g. network connected
sensors, to smartphones as well as end-user laptops. While leveraging the
ubiquitous availability and specific capabilities of such devices brings
many opportunities, it also bears new challenges unknown to traditional cloud
services. Some of these challenges include the heterogeneity of fog nodes,
their accessibility, e.g. behind private networks, and extended security and
privacy requirements.
Opportunities as well as the challenges have been widely addressed in the
respective literature, however implementations, let alone actively deployed
platforms, are rare.


The contributions of this paper are as follows:
We present Seattle, a practical platform for \gls{fc} research
with a real-world deployment on heterogeneous nodes,
including desktop and laptop machines, Android devices,
and routers and embedded devices running OpenWrt.
%Seattle nodes host Python-based \glspl{VM} that can run
%general-purpose code on a variety of platforms,
%and which self-isolate so as to not
%affect the safety and performance of the host node.
Seattle's system architecture caters to a variety of use cases,
ranging from peer-to-peer deployments to full-fledged
provisioning by a dedicated operator, and cooperative setups
where different stakeholders federate multiple parallel running
instances of services.
Our own deployment of Seattle has been used in multiple contexts
including research~\cite{li2015fence,rafetseder2013sensorium,zhuang2014sensibility,Eisl1010:Service,Tuts1010:Sustained,collares2011smart,zhuang2015privacy,cappos2014blursense,7133607} and education~\cite{Wallace_CCSC_2011,Cappos_CCSCCP_2010,Cappos_CCSCNW_2009,Cappos_SIGCSE_2014,Hooshangi_SIGCSE_2015};
other groups have successfully reused and augmented Seattle components
for their purposes~\cite{chard2010social,chard12ssc,caton2014social,muller2014tomato,tomato,eittenberger2012doubtless,zhuang2012distributed,zhuang2014taking,tredger2013building}.
