\section{Introduction And Related Work}

In recent years the term ``fog computing'' has been established to describe
cloud computing at the edge of the network. Fog networks are typically
characterized by the large number of geographically distributed nodes, ranging
from embedded systems, e.g. network connected
sensors, to smartphones as well as end-user laptops
\cite{Bonomi:2012:FCR:2342509.2342513,Yi:2015:SFC:2757384.2757397}.
While leveraging the
ubiquitous availability and specific capabilities of such devices brings
many opportunities, it also bears new challenges unknown to traditional cloud
services. Some of these challenges include the heterogeneity of fog nodes,
their accessibility, e.g. behind private networks, and extended security and
privacy requirements \cite{botta_integration_2016}.
Opportunities as well as the challenges have been widely addressed in the
respective literature, however implementations, let alone actively deployed and
publicly available platforms that can be used in the fog context, are rare. \\ \\

For instance in~\cite{bellavista_feasibility_2017} the authors investigate the
applicability of docker containers for fog computing. The work uses and extends
the Open Source Kura framework to create IoT gateways that control the information
flow between fog nodes and the cloud, while also reviewing and benchmarking
different container related technologies used in the fog nodes.
The focus of the work tends towards IoT computing, where tailored services run
on fog nodes to gather data that is forwarded to to cloud for further processing.
A similiar evaluation of docker containers for edge computing can be found in
\cite{ismail_evaluation_2015}.

Others have contributed fog platforms for very specific use cases, e.g.
an emergency alert system using smartphones that propagate alerts to nearby
emergency departments \cite{7134091}; or an ``Adaptive Operations Platform''
to effectively apply equipment failure models in the context of industrial
IoT \cite{gazis_components_2015}.

On the other hand there are implementations that address specific individual
fog computing issues, like Dsouza et al. who propose a framework for
policy management to authenticate the various actors in, e.g. smart
transportation systems \cite{dsouza_policy-driven_2014}.

Additionally, proprietary business \lukas{Is there an adjective for `... that costs money'?} solutions exist: Cisco IOx promotes a
system that allows traditional Linux application development on
Cisco IOS powered networking devices\cite{cisco_iox}.
And Google recently released ``Google IoT cloud'', which sells a system for
cloud based device management and a protocol bridge to connect edge nodes to,
e.g. cloud analytic systems\cite{google_iot_core}.

In contrast, Seattle does not only specify a flexible FOSS platform architecture,
is also has over 8 years of experience of operating a general-purpose
infrastructure used among others for network research and education.

The contributions of this paper are as follows:
We present Seattle, a practical platform for \gls{fc} research
with a real-world deployment on heterogeneous nodes,
including desktop and laptop machines, Android devices,
and routers and embedded devices running OpenWrt.
%Seattle nodes host Python-based \glspl{VM} that can run
%general-purpose code on a variety of platforms,
%and which self-isolate so as to not
%affect the safety and performance of the host node.
Seattle's system architecture caters to a variety of use cases,
ranging from peer-to-peer deployments to full-fledged
provisioning by a dedicated operator, and cooperative setups,
where different stakeholders federate multiple parallel running
instances of services.
Our own deployment of Seattle has been used in multiple contexts
including research~\cite{li2015fence,rafetseder2013sensorium,zhuang2014sensibility,Eisl1010:Service,Tuts1010:Sustained,collares2011smart,zhuang2015privacy,cappos2014blursense,7133607} and education~\cite{Wallace_CCSC_2011,Cappos_CCSCCP_2010,Cappos_CCSCNW_2009,Cappos_SIGCSE_2014,Hooshangi_SIGCSE_2015};
other groups have successfully reused and augmented Seattle components
for their purposes~\cite{chard2010social,chard12ssc,caton2014social,muller2014tomato,tomato,eittenberger2012doubtless,zhuang2012distributed,zhuang2014taking,tredger2013building}.
