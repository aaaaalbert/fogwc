In this paper we present Seattle, a practical and publicly accessible
fog computing platform with 8 years of deployment history.
Seattle's architecture
supports a multitude of deployment models, from peer-to-peer to full-fledged
provisioning by a dedicated operator. Its components and interfaces are
designed for compatibility and reuse, and align with the trust boundaries
that exist between different stakeholders.

Besides our own use of Seattle as a distributed network testbed for
teaching and research, outside groups have used existing Seattle
components, and constructed new components with compatible interfaces,
to adapt the platform to their needs. This has resulted in edge node
selection tools based on social graphs, an Android-compatible computing
sandbox that can access smartphone sensors, \albert{etc.}

Seattle is FOSS, .... ?
