# Our Potential Topics

### Existing material
* Design issues of interfaces etc. (Tsumiki)
* Practical deployment and usage stats (GREE'13)
* Security, safety, isolation, restrictions (Fence ATC'15)
* Applications aka self-cites galore
* The components (Tsumiki)
* Open source! Reusable! (GitHub)
* Offspring: Sensibility (MESS'16, Usenix Login, SenSys)
* Cross-platform, high-level (all of the above)

### Other ideas
* Your
* ideas
* here
* mine
* further
* down
* such as
* Things that did *not* work out too great yet:
  * Affix
  * Other sandbox types
  * "Compatibility" with "nicer" tech like SSH/HTTPS/...?
* Outreach, organic growth and possible limits
