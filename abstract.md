`$INTRO_FOG_COMPUTING_IS_VERY_RELEVANT_BECAUSE`

In this paper we present Seattle, a platform for fog-type workloads
that we have been operating over the past 8 years.
We discuss Seattle's architecture, implementation, and operation.
In particular, Seattle uses a Python-based sandbox to securely
isolate workloads; its web-based clearinghouse allows for managing
resources on distributed end nodes; `$AND_SOMETHING_ELSE_THAT_IS_COOL`.
Seattle is designed so that different implementations of its
components can be used interchangeably. This property is explored
and exploited in various offspring projects. For example, Sensibility
Testbed provides an Android-based, sensor-enabled runtime for use
on smartphones and tablet devices.
